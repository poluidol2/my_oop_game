# notZombie
my first python game

This is my first game.
You play for a zombie who wants to become human, so you need to avoid eating brains.

To start playing, just run "not_zombie.py" with your python.

It's have simple controls:
-> move right
<- move left
space - jump

So, lets become a little more human);))
